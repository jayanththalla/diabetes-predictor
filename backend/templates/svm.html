      <h1>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h1>
      <h3>
        Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised machine learning
        models used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs aim to find
        the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different
        classes in a high-dimensional space. The hyperplane is positioned so
        that it maximizes the margin, which is the distance between the
        hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class, known as support
        vectors. Key features of SVMs include their effectiveness in
        high-dimensional spaces and their ability to handle non-linear decision
        boundaries through the kernel trick, which implicitly maps data into
        higher dimensions. SVMs are robust against overfitting, especially in
        high-dimensional spaces, due to the margin maximization objective.
        However, choosing the right kernel function and regularization
        parameters is crucial for optimal performance. SVMs are widely used in
        various applications such as text categorization, image classification,
        and bioinformatics, where they excel in scenarios with complex data
        structures and clear class separations.
