      <h1>Decision Tree</h1>
      <h3>
        Decision trees are versatile machine learning algorithms used for both
        classification and regression tasks. They operate by recursively
        partitioning the data into subsets based on the most significant
        attribute at each node, aiming to minimize impurity (e.g., Gini impurity
        for classification, mean squared error for regression). Each internal
        node represents a decision point, and each leaf node represents a class
        label or a predicted value. Decision trees are intuitive, as they mimic
        human decision-making processes and are easy to interpret, allowing
        insights into which features are most influential. However, they can
        overfit noisy data, requiring techniques like pruning, limiting tree
        depth, or using ensemble methods like Random Forests to enhance
        performance. Decision trees are widely used in various domains,
        including finance, healthcare, and marketing, due to their transparency
        and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data effectively.
