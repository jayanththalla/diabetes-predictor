## 🧬 Machine Learning Models Used

| Model               | Description                                                               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SVM (Support Vector Machine)     | Supervised learning model for classification/regression                    |
| Random Forest       | Ensemble of decision trees for robust and accurate classification        |
| Logistic Regression | Ideal for binary classification like diabetes (yes/no)                  |
| Gradient Boosting   | Sequential model improving weak learners using residuals                 |

## 📊 Key Health Stats

- **422 Million** adults live with diabetes globally
- **50%** of cases go undiagnosed
- **2–3x** higher risk of heart disease in diabetic patients
- **95% accuracy** achieved in predictions using advanced ML models

## 💡 Understanding Diabetes Types

- **Type 1**: Autoimmune, insulin-dependent, early onset
- **Type 2**: Lifestyle-related, most common, often preventable
- **Gestational**: During pregnancy, risk to both mother and baby
- **Prediabetes**: Warning stage, reversible with lifestyle changes

---

## ⚠️ Common Symptoms

- Excessive thirst and urination
- Unexplained weight loss
- Blurred vision
- Fatigue
- Slow-healing wounds

---

## 🛡️ Prevention Tips

- Balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains
- 150+ minutes/week of moderate physical activity
- Regular health check-ups
